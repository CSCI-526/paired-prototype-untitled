# White Lotus Fusion

A **cooking simulation + puzzle game** where instead of following clear recipes, players must **interpret customer requests** and creatively reverse-engineer dishes to satisfy cravings.  

---

## Logline
Instead of precise instructions, customers describe their dishes in **funny and ambiguous ways**. Players must **decode requests**, experiment with ingredients, and creatively combine cooking methods to deliver dishes that may have multiple valid answers.

---

## Core Concept

### Genre
Cooking Simulation + Puzzle

### Twist
Unlike traditional cooking games that focus on **time management** and **precision**, our game emphasizes:
- **Puzzle-solving**: Decoding vague customer descriptions into valid dishes.  
- **Creativity**: Encouraging experimentation with unusual combinations that may lead to hidden or humorous outcomes.  

---

## Key Features

- **Ambiguous Customer Requests**  
  - Customers describe dishes without recipes.  
  - Multiple valid solutions possible.  

- **Puzzle Mechanics**  
  - Each order is a mini puzzle that tests logic, creativity, and interpretation.  

- **Cooking & Serving Loop**  
  - Ingredients: fruits, vegetables, meats, fish, rice  
  - Plates: bowls, cups, small/large plates, custom dishes  
  - Tools: knives, cutting tables, stoves  
  - Methods: boiling, frying, steaming  

- **Progression Systems**  
  - Star system (Michelin-inspired ratings)  
  - Upgrades & Achievements  
  - Customer waves or open-hour style service  

- **Art & Style**  
  - TBD (2D isometric board-game style or 3D open kitchen environment under consideration)

## Genre Research

We studied cooking/puzzle games to identify common tropes and opportunities for innovation:
- **Overcooked / 2**  
- **Good Pizza, Great Pizza**  
- **Shawarma Legend**  
- **Gemporium: A Cute Mining Sim**  
- **Chef Life: A Restaurant Simulator**

### Common Tropes
- Time pressure  
- Unlocks & upgrades  
- Mistake consequences  
- Ratings & scoring systems  
- Collectibles  
- Lives  

> Our innovation lies in **how orders are delivered and solved** (interpretation instead of instruction).

## Prototype Description

**White Lotus Fusion** is a cooking simulation game featuring a **distinctive puzzle-solving mechanic**.  
Players run a restaurant and earn revenue by serving dishes. Instead of being given explicit recipes, customers provide **ambiguous descriptions**, and players must use creativity and logic to cook the correct meal.
